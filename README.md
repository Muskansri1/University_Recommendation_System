## About the Project
The opportunity to study in the US has been a dream for many international students. More than 1 million foreign students apply to the graduate school for higher studies in the US. Multiple factors such as the tuition fees, university ranking, courses available, return on investment, etc. play a huge role in the final selection of a university,

The abundance of information and lack of credible data on the internet often leaves ambitious students in a dilemma. They are often left confused about the major they want to get in or the professor they are interested in, or even their chances of getting into the university.

In this project, we aim to build a university recommendation system that would act as a one-stop platform for the students to aid them in their university shortlisting process.

The application/website would feature data from data sources like Yocket, USnews, Admits.fyi, Edulix, timeshighereducation etc. We would scrap the mentioned data from the university websites. The data collected would be cleaned and fed into the database which would be standardized so that the potential students could do their research. The students could have an overview of the entire course curriculum, professors who would be taking a particular course at the university, and university ranking.

We also aim to include a prediction system in the application to let the potential students predict their chances of getting into the university based on their GRE, TOEFL, Undergrad GPA, work experience, etc.

## Scope of the project for the contributors:
* To collect the relevant data from the data sources
    * Web Scraping from different website
    * Identifying credible data and data cleaning
* Data sorting and normalization based on the system architecture and design
* Database creation with relevant standardizations and customizations
* Incorporating the prediction module for the universities 

## Usecases:-
1. Would the database be able to predict the probability admit rate based on my profile?
2. Would the database be able to show me suggestions based on my profile?
3. Would the database have information regarding the financial requirements of a university or the total finances required to complete the course in a university?
4. Would the database have information on the ranking of colleges and its other USPs'?
5. Would the database feature details like ROI, average housing details, etc. related to the universities?
6. Would the database show all the courses offered in the universities?
7. Would the database have the information on the faculty details of a particular university?
8. Would the database be able to suggest the different skills/prerequisites required to pursue a course?
9. Would the database suggest colleges based on ambitious, moderate, and safety standards?
10. Would the database have information about hiring companies sponsoring the students for H1B visas?
11. What are the chances of a student getting into a top 10 University?
12. What are the chances of a student getting into the desired course?
13. What is the probability of a student getting a course under the desired professor?
14. What are the chances of getting a scholarship at the university?
15. What is the location of the university with respect to the weather?
16. What is the average pay scale after course completion?
17. What are the chances of getting an on-campus job at the university?
18. What companies hire students from the university?
19. What are the chances of getting an internship at the university?
20. Are there Research opportunities available?
