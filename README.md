## About the Project
The opportunity to study in the US has been a dream for many international students. More than 1 million foreign students apply to the graduate school for higher studies in the US. Multiple factors such as the tuition fees, university ranking, courses available, return on investment, etc. play a huge role in the final selection of a university,

The abundance of information and lack of credible data on the internet often leaves ambitious students in a dilemma. They are often left confused about the major they want to get in or the professor they are interested in, or even their chances of getting into the university.

In this project, we aim to build a university recommendation system that would act as a one-stop platform for the students to aid them in their university shortlisting process.

The application/website would feature data from data sources like Yocket, USnews, Admits.fyi, Edulix, timeshighereducation etc. We would scrap the mentioned data from the university websites. The data collected would be cleaned and fed into the database which would be standardized so that the potential students could do their research. The students could have an overview of the entire course curriculum, professors who would be taking a particular course at the university, and university ranking.

We also aim to include a prediction system in the application to let the potential students predict their chances of getting into the university based on their GRE, TOEFL, Undergrad GPA, work experience, etc.
